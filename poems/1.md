## A Little Poem
Whispers in twilight,  
Stars softly blink,  
Shadows dance gently,  
Moonlight’s sweet ink.  

Leaves rustle low,  
Crickets begin,  
Night wraps around,  
Dreams draw us in.  

Cool breeze sighs,  
Clouds drift away,  
Heartbeats echo,  
In night’s ballet.  

Hope flickers bright,  
Memories unfold,  
Time stands still,  
In stories told.  

Embers of warmth,  
Silent embrace,  
Under the sky,  
We find our place.
